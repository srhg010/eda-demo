"""
`matplotlib.pyplot` is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides
an implicit,  MATLAB-like, way of plotting.  It also opens figures on your
screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.

pyplot is mainly intended for interactive plots and simple cases of
programmatic plot generation::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    x = np.arange(0, 5, 0.1)
    y = np.sin(x)
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()

The explicit object-oriented API is recommended for complex plots, though
pyplot is still usually used to create the figure and often the Axes in the
figure. See `.pyplot.figure`, `.pyplot.subplots`, and
`.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` to create figures, and
:doc:`Axes API </api/axes_api>` for the plotting methods on an Axes::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    x = np.arange(0, 5, 0.1)
    y = np.sin(x)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()


See :ref:`api_interfaces` for an explanation of the tradeoffs between the
implicit and explicit interfaces.

    Notes
    -----
    **Saving figures to file and showing a window at the same time**

    If you want an image file as well as a user interface window, use
    `.pyplot.savefig` before `.pyplot.show`. At the end of (a blocking)
    ``show()`` the figure is closed and thus unregistered from pyplot. Calling
    `.pyplot.savefig` afterwards would save a new and thus empty figure. This
    limitation of command order does not apply if the show is non-blocking or
    if you keep a reference to the figure and use `.Figure.savefig`.

    **Auto-show in jupyter notebooks**

    The jupyter backends (activated via ``%matplotlib inline``,
    ``%matplotlib notebook``, or ``%matplotlib widget``), call ``show()`` at
    the end of every cell by default. Thus, you usually don't have to call it

    """
    Create a new figure, or activate an existing figure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : int or str or `.Figure` or `.SubFigure`, optional
        A unique identifier for the figure.

        If a figure with that identifier already exists, this figure is made
        active and returned. An integer refers to the ``Figure.number``
        attribute, a string refers to the figure label.

        If there is no figure with the identifier or *num* is not given, a new
        figure is created, made active and returned.  If *num* is an int, it
        will be used for the ``Figure.number`` attribute, otherwise, an
        auto-generated integer value is used (starting at 1 and incremented
        for each new figure). If *num* is a string, the figure label and the
        window title is set to this value.  If num is a ``SubFigure``, its
        parent ``Figure`` is activated.

    figsize : (float, float), default: :rc:`figure.figsize`
        Width, height in inches.

    dpi : float, default: :rc:`figure.dpi`
        The resolution of the figure in dots-per-inch.

    facecolor : :mpltype:`color`, default: :rc:`figure.facecolor`
        The background color.

    edgecolor : :mpltype:`color`, default: :rc:`figure.edgecolor`
        The border color.

    frameon : bool, default: True
        If False, suppress drawing the figure frame.

    FigureClass : subclass of `~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
        If set, an instance of this subclass will be created, rather than a
        plain `.Figure`.

    clear : bool, default: False
        If True and the figure already exists, then it is cleared.

    layout : {'constrained', 'compressed', 'tight', 'none', `.LayoutEngine`, None}, \
default: None
        The layout mechanism for positioning of plot elements to avoid
        overlapping Axes decorations (labels, ticks, etc). Note that layout
        managers can measurably slow down figure display.

        - 'constrained': The constrained layout solver adjusts Axes sizes
          to avoid overlapping Axes decorations.  Can handle complex plot
          layouts and colorbars, and is thus recommended.

          See :ref:`constrainedlayout_guide`
          for examples.

        - 'compressed': uses the same algorithm as 'constrained', but
          removes extra space between fixed-aspect-ratio Axes.  Best for
          simple grids of Axes.

        - 'tight': Use the tight layout mechanism. This is a relatively
          simple algorithm that adjusts the subplot parameters so that
          decorations do not overlap. See `.Figure.set_tight_layout` for
          further details.

        - 'none': Do not use a layout engine.

        - A `.LayoutEngine` instance. Builtin layout classes are
          `.ConstrainedLayoutEngine` and `.TightLayoutEngine`, more easily
          accessible by 'constrained' and 'tight'.  Passing an instance
          allows third parties to provide their own layout engine.

        If not given, fall back to using the parameters *tight_layout* and
        *constrained_layout*, including their config defaults
        :rc:`figure.autolayout` and :rc:`figure.constrained_layout.use`.

    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments are passed to the `.Figure` constructor.

    Returns
    -------
    `~matplotlib.figure.Figure`

    Notes
    -----
    A newly created figure is passed to the `~.FigureCanvasBase.new_manager`
    method or the `new_figure_manager` function provided by the current
    backend, which install a canvas and a manager on the figure.

    Once this is done, :rc:`figure.hooks` are called, one at a time, on the
    figure; these hooks allow arbitrary customization of the figure (e.g.,
    attaching callbacks) or of associated elements (e.g., modifying the
    toolbar).  See :doc:`/gallery/user_interfaces/mplcvd` for an example of
    toolbar customization.

    If you are creating many figures, make sure you explicitly call
    `.pyplot.close` on the figures you are not using, because this will
    enable pyplot to properly clean up the memory.

    `~matplotlib.rcParams` defines the default values, which can be modified
    in the matplotlibrc file.

    ----------
    arg : None or 4-tuple
        The exact behavior of this function depends on the type:

    projection : {None, 'aitoff', 'hammer', 'lambert', 'mollweide', \
'polar', 'rectilinear', str}, optional
        The projection type of the `~.axes.Axes`. *str* is the name of
        a custom projection, see `~matplotlib.projections`. The default
        None results in a 'rectilinear' projection.

    polar : bool, default: False
        If True, equivalent to projection='polar'.

    sharex, sharey : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, optional
        Share the x or y `~matplotlib.axis` with sharex and/or sharey.
        The axis will have the same limits, ticks, and scale as the axis
        of the shared Axes.

    label : str
        A label for the returned Axes.

    Returns
    -------
    `~.axes.Axes`, or a subclass of `~.axes.Axes`
        The returned Axes class depends on the projection used. It is
        `~.axes.Axes` if rectilinear projection is used and
        `.projections.polar.PolarAxes` if polar projection is used.

'polar', 'rectilinear', str}, optional
        The projection type of the subplot (`~.axes.Axes`). *str* is the name
        of a custom projection, see `~matplotlib.projections`. The default
        None results in a 'rectilinear' projection.

    polar : bool, default: False
        If True, equivalent to projection='polar'.

    sharex, sharey : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, optional
        Share the x or y `~matplotlib.axis` with sharex and/or sharey. The
        axis will have the same limits, ticks, and scale as the axis of the
        shared Axes.

    label : str
        A label for the returned Axes.

    Returns
    -------
    `~.axes.Axes`

        The Axes of the subplot. The returned Axes can actually be an instance
        of a subclass, such as `.projections.polar.PolarAxes` for polar
        projections.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs
        This method also takes the keyword arguments for the returned Axes
        base class; except for the *figure* argument. The keyword arguments
        for the rectilinear base class `~.axes.Axes` can be found in
        the following table but there might also be other keyword
        arguments if another projection is used.

        %(Axes:kwdoc)s

    Notes
    -----
    Creating a new Axes will delete any preexisting Axes that
    overlaps with it beyond sharing a boundary::

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        # plot a line, implicitly creating a subplot(111)
        plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
        # now create a subplot which represents the top plot of a grid
        # with 2 rows and 1 column. Since this subplot will overlap the
        # first, the plot (and its Axes) previously created, will be removed
        plt.subplot(211)

    If you do not want this behavior, use the `.Figure.add_subplot` method
    or the `.pyplot.axes` function instead.

    If no *kwargs* are passed and there exists an Axes in the location
    specified by *args* then that Axes will be returned rather than a new
    Axes being created.

    If *kwargs* are passed and there exists an Axes in the location
    specified by *args*, the projection type is the same, and the
    *kwargs* match with the existing Axes, then the existing Axes is
    returned.  Otherwise a new Axes is created with the specified
    parameters.  We save a reference to the *kwargs* which we use
    for this comparison.  If any of the values in *kwargs* are
    mutable we will not detect the case where they are mutated.
    In these cases we suggest using `.Figure.add_subplot` and the
    explicit Axes API rather than the implicit pyplot API.

    Create a figure and a set of subplots.

    This utility wrapper makes it convenient to create common layouts of
    subplots, including the enclosing figure object, in a single call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nrows, ncols : int, default: 1
        Number of rows/columns of the subplot grid.

    sharex, sharey : bool or {'none', 'all', 'row', 'col'}, default: False
        Controls sharing of properties among x (*sharex*) or y (*sharey*)
        axes:

        - True or 'all': x- or y-axis will be shared among all subplots.
        - False or 'none': each subplot x- or y-axis will be independent.
        - 'row': each subplot row will share an x- or y-axis.
        - 'col': each subplot column will share an x- or y-axis.

        When subplots have a shared x-axis along a column, only the x tick
        labels of the bottom subplot are created. Similarly, when subplots
        have a shared y-axis along a row, only the y tick labels of the first
        column subplot are created. To later turn other subplots' ticklabels
        on, use `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params`.

        When subplots have a shared axis that has units, calling
        `.Axis.set_units` will update each axis with the new units.

        Note that it is not possible to unshare axes.

    squeeze : bool, default: True
        - If True, extra dimensions are squeezed out from the returned
          array of `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`:

          - if only one subplot is constructed (nrows=ncols=1), the
            resulting single Axes object is returned as a scalar.
          - for Nx1 or 1xM subplots, the returned object is a 1D numpy
            object array of Axes objects.
          - for NxM, subplots with N>1 and M>1 are returned as a 2D array.

        - If False, no squeezing at all is done: the returned Axes object is
          always a 2D array containing Axes instances, even if it ends up
          being 1x1.

    width_ratios : array-like of length *ncols*, optional
        Defines the relative widths of the columns. Each column gets a
        relative width of ``width_ratios[i] / sum(width_ratios)``.
        If not given, all columns will have the same width.  Equivalent
        to ``gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [...]}``.

    height_ratios : array-like of length *nrows*, optional
        Defines the relative heights of the rows. Each row gets a
        relative height of ``height_ratios[i] / sum(height_ratios)``.
        If not given, all rows will have the same height. Convenience
        for ``gridspec_kw={'height_ratios': [...]}``.

    subplot_kw : dict, optional
        Dict with keywords passed to the
        `~matplotlib.figure.Figure.add_subplot` call used to create each
        subplot.

    gridspec_kw : dict, optional
        Dict with keywords passed to the `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec`
        constructor used to create the grid the subplots are placed on.

    **fig_kw
        All additional keyword arguments are passed to the
        `.pyplot.figure` call.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : `.Figure`

    ax : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes` or array of Axes
        *ax* can be either a single `~.axes.Axes` object, or an array of Axes
        objects if more than one subplot was created.  The dimensions of the
        resulting array can be controlled with the squeeze keyword, see above.

        Typical idioms for handling the return value are::

            # using the variable ax for single a Axes
            fig, ax = plt.subplots()

            # using the variable axs for multiple Axes
            fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)

            # using tuple unpacking for multiple Axes
            fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
            fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2)

        The names ``ax`` and pluralized ``axs`` are preferred over ``axes``
        because for the latter it's not clear if it refers to a single
        `~.axes.Axes` instance or a collection of these.

    Build a layout of Axes based on ASCII art or nested lists.

    This is a helper function to build complex GridSpec layouts visually.

    See :ref:`mosaic`
    for an example and full API documentation

    Parameters
    ----------
    mosaic : list of list of {hashable or nested} or str

        A visual layout of how you want your Axes to be arranged
        labeled as strings.  For example ::

           x = [['A panel', 'A panel', 'edge'],
                ['C panel', '.',       'edge']]

        produces 4 Axes:

        - 'A panel' which is 1 row high and spans the first two columns
        - 'edge' which is 2 rows high and is on the right edge
        - 'C panel' which in 1 row and 1 column wide in the bottom left
        - a blank space 1 row and 1 column wide in the bottom center

        Any of the entries in the layout can be a list of lists
        of the same form to create nested layouts.

        If input is a str, then it must be of the form ::

          '''
          AAE
          C.E
          '''

        where each character is a column and each line is a row.
        This only allows only single character Axes labels and does
        not allow nesting but is very terse.

    sharex, sharey : bool, default: False
        If True, the x-axis (*sharex*) or y-axis (*sharey*) will be shared
        among all subplots.  In that case, tick label visibility and axis units
        behave as for `subplots`.  If False, each subplot's x- or y-axis will
        be independent.

    width_ratios : array-like of length *ncols*, optional
        Defines the relative widths of the columns. Each column gets a
        relative width of ``width_ratios[i] / sum(width_ratios)``.
        If not given, all columns will have the same width.  Convenience
        for ``gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [...]}``.

    height_ratios : array-like of length *nrows*, optional
        Defines the relative heights of the rows. Each row gets a
        relative height of ``height_ratios[i] / sum(height_ratios)``.
        If not given, all rows will have the same height. Convenience
        for ``gridspec_kw={'height_ratios': [...]}``.

    empty_sentinel : object, optional
        Entry in the layout to mean "leave this space empty".  Defaults
        to ``'.'``. Note, if *layout* is a string, it is processed via
        `inspect.cleandoc` to remove leading white space, which may
        interfere with using white-space as the empty sentinel.

    subplot_kw : dict, optional
        Dictionary with keywords passed to the `.Figure.add_subplot` call
        used to create each subplot.  These values may be overridden by
        values in *per_subplot_kw*.

    per_subplot_kw : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping the Axes identifiers or tuples of identifiers
        to a dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the
        `.Figure.add_subplot` call used to create each subplot.  The values
        in these dictionaries have precedence over the values in
        *subplot_kw*.

        If *mosaic* is a string, and thus all keys are single characters,
        it is possible to use a single string instead of a tuple as keys;
        i.e. ``"AB"`` is equivalent to ``("A", "B")``.

        .. versionadded:: 3.7

    gridspec_kw : dict, optional
        Dictionary with keywords passed to the `.GridSpec` constructor used
        to create the grid the subplots are placed on.

    **fig_kw
        All additional keyword arguments are passed to the
        `.pyplot.figure` call.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : `.Figure`

    dict[label, Axes]
       A dictionary mapping the labels to the Axes objects.  The order of
